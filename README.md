[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) solutions.

These are in JavaScript (mostly ES6), and are intended to be run in Node.js. I make no claims that these are the _best_ solutions, but if they're pushed here, they do at least **work**.

Most solutions:
 - Can be run with no arguments beyond the filename, e.g. `node star1.js`
 - Should be run with `dayXX` as the working directory (becuase they read input as `./input.txt`)
 - Use `input.txt` as a means of feeding in _my specific input_ generated by the Advent of Code website
 - Let you replace contents of `input.txt` with your own input data to see it work for your cases
 - Use `small_input.txt` to replicate example input from the problem description (small-scale or base case algorithm POC)
